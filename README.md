# Pong No Walls (AI)
## Devontae Reid

The variation has no walls at all; it has six paddles (three for the player, and three for the computer).
The player has one side paddle (moves up/down), and two horizontal paddles (top/bottom).
The computer moves its paddles by tracking the x and y position of the ball, and adjusts its paddles’
position accordingly. The velocity of the computer’s paddles can be made to be slower (easier game),
or faster (harder game, the computer almost never misses).
The player moves its paddles using the arrow keys. The side paddle moves with the up and down
arrow keys. The horizontal paddles move synchronously with the left and right arrow keys.
This game can be built on top of your code from Alien Invasions (the ship becomes the paddles, and
the aliens become a single ball).
